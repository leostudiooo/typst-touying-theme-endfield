= Fundamental Phenomenology

== Dimensional Topology

The Ætherside represents a comprehensive dimensional state at Depth 1, overlapping with realspace (Depth 0) across subterranean, atmospheric, and orbital regions. @depth-equation shows the correlation between proximity to rift boundaries and local Depth readings.

$ D(x) = 1 - e^(-lambda x) $ <depth-equation>

Where $D$ represents local Depth readings and $x$ denotes proximity to rift boundaries.

== Biological Hazards

=== Active Blight Etiology

Direct exposure to Ætherside matter causes *irreversible* termination of biological processes#footnote[Band Accord Resolution 934 strictly prohibits live-subject transposition experiments.].

Conversely, matter emerging from Ætherside generates Active Blight in realspace, presenting existential contamination risks.

= Engineering Applications

== Originium Modulation

Cultivating Originium deposits reduces local Depth readings, effectively stabilizing dimensional barriers and containing rift expansion. However, operational interference with Arts-dependent machinery remains problematic in overlap zones.

== Experimental Methodologies

#block(fill: luma(250), inset: 1em, radius: 0.5em)[We can use `#pause` and `#meanwhile` to #pause demonstrate critical safety protocols.]

#pause

All personnel must utilize shielded exosuits when Depth readings exceed 0.3.

#meanwhile

Meanwhile, #pause energy extraction operations #pause require redundant containment arrays to prevent cascade failures.

== Notes

If your are new to Typst and Touying, you can check out:
- #link("https://typst.app/docs") for Typst, and
- #link("https://touying-typ.github.io/") for Touying.

I personally recommend you to use Visual Studio Code with a Typst extension for editing and real-time preview.

You may want to install `Harmony OS Sans` and `Gilroy` for better display effect. The default main font is `Harmony OS Sans`, and the focus slide uses a customized setting for the "WARNING" text with `Gilroy` for better emphasis. *Note that `Gilroy` is a commercial font*, you may need to purchase a license for non-personal use.

== Known Issues

1. Unfortunately, the HarmonyOS Sans family has a non-standarized font stretch metadata, and typst would interpret the font weight "light" to use a condensed variant of the font #text(weight: "light", "just like this"), and _italic_ style would also be affected. *Bold* renders correctly for now. You cannot fix this by using `#text(stretch: 100%)` since the condensed variant also has a `stretch: 1000` metadata. You may want to use `Source Sans` or `Source Han Sans` as an alternative, uninstall the condensed series, try a community workaround #footnote[#link("https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2917")], or wait for an official fix from Typst in the future #footnote[#link("https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2098"), still open by Feb 2026.]. Or, you can optimistically regard it as a feature of the font family.

2. Sidebar navigation does not work responsively (i.e. does not change outline depth or text size based on the number of slides, it _overflows_ as you can see in the left). Similar issue also exists for mini-slides, but you can customize like `mini-slides: (height: 3em)`. This is due to the limit of touying's built-in `custom-progressive-outline` and `mini-slides` components. Maybe in the future I can implement a more advanced version of these components to fix this. Any useful sugeggetions or PRs are welcome! But if you dont want the bother, just use `navigation: "none"`.

3. Also, the decoration bar of the title slide has a similar issue. Currently this can be fixed by setting a larger `title-height` in `config-store` when the title wraps to multiple lines, but this is not an ideal solution. Again, any useful suggestions or PRs are welcome!
